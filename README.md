# Week-6-Giphy-API

Hello and welcome to my week 6 GIF API homework. 

this project is our week 6 homework for University of Richmond Coding Bootcamp.

I didnt have much time as i would have liked to complete everything possible. Some people that I sit next to in class certainly got their homeworks much nicer looking. However this does acheive all the requirements for the assignment.

Built with Visual Studio Code, Git Bash, and the Giphy API.

Written in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery and Ajax.

It is simple enough to use. When a user clicks on a button at the top of the screen, the Giphy API will locate gifs that match the button value to the gif keyword and return the appropriate gifs. The user can also add buttons with the text box and submit button. Added buttons will work in the same way.
